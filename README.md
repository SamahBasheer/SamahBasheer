# Hello World, I'm Samah! 👋 Nice to virtually meet you! 🙂

I am Full Stack Web Developer in Lebanon with a Bachelor’s Degree and 3+ years professional experience in Web Development.

## 💻 My Technical Stack<br>

Languages: JavaScript (AJAX, JSON), HTML, CSS, SQL, MYSQL, PHP, C++, C#, Python <br>
Frameworks & Libraries: jQuery, Bootstrap, Laravel <br>
Tools:  MongoDB, MySQL, Sqlite, GitHub, VSCode, Photoshop

✨ Some fun things about me:
* I love hiking
* I'm into all things Disney
* My weakness is ice cream
